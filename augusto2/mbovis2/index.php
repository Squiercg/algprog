		<p>
			Bovine tuberculosis is a infectious disease caused by the bacteria <i>Mycobacterium
				bovis</i>. It is responsible for considerable economic losses,
			accounting for more than 3 billions around the world.
		</p>

		<!-- <p>In Brazil, there is a beef exportation block for animals from properties around regions of disease focus.</p> -->

		<p>
			Besides the economics aspects, Bovine Tuberculosis are still a public
			health problem. Although most human cases are caused from <i>M.
				tuberculosis</i>, the following facts have turned researchers attention
			to the implication of <i>M. bovis</i> in human:
		<ul>
			<li>Several outbreaks of Multiple Drug Resistance (MDR) <i>M.
					bovis</i> among HIV co-infected patients. This fact arises the high
				risk of dissemination of MDR <i>M. bovis</i>, specially on parts of
				Africa where <i>M. bovis</i> in animals and HIV humans co-exist.
			</li>

			<li>The co-infection of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis by
				<i>M. bovis.</i>
			</li>

			<li>The reemergence of human tuberculosis by <i>M. bovis</i>
				that came with immigrants from regions where tuberculosis is still
				prevalent have been document on Europe and United States.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In this project, we aim to develop a traceability platform for
			Bovine Tuberculosis in South America, providing up-to-date
			information about the disease evolution.</p>
